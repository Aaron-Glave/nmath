Rather than a list use
2. Append and Read Mode ("a+"):
This mode also appends to the end of the file or creates it if it doesn't exist. Additionally, it allows you to read from the file. When opened in "a+" mode, the file pointer is initially at the end of the file. To read from the beginning, you need to use seek(0).
Code example:

with open("my_file.txt", "a+") as file:
    file.write("New data added.\n")
    
    # To read from the beginning of the file after appending
    file.seek(0) 
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
